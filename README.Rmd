An R package to generate a rapid Least Concern Red List assessment for plant species

## Overview
Quickly determine if a plant species is likely to be non-threatened (Least Concern - See [IUCN Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org/)). Generate minimal documentation for a Least Concern species and submit to the IUCN Red List via [SIS Connect](https://connect.iucnredlist.org/) (registration needed)

## Installation

Not yet on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org), but you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stevenpbachman/LCRapid")
```

## Usage

The workflow is broken into several steps and each step can be run independently:

1.	`name_search` check name status against taxonomic backbones 
2.	`get_points` gather occurrence records 
3.	`filter_native` clean points with native range
4.	`calculate_metrics` calculate metrics
5.	`apply_thresholds` assess whether species is Least Concern
6.	`make_files` generate data files or reports
 
The batch option allows you to run multiple species.


### Getting started

```{r example}
library(LCRapid)
## check a name against GBIF, Kew Names Matching Service and Plants of the World Online
name_search("Poa annua L.")

#get_points()
#etc...
```
